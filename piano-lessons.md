## Testimonial 1

In one year my children have learned over fifty songs!

Caylia expertly engages my daughters in specific, age-appropriate programs tailored to their interests and abilities. She tunes in to the comments my children make to enhance their understanding and appreciation of music.

I am so thankful that we were referred to Caylia for our music instruction. - Jamie, Tiburon

## Can I learn the latest XXXX Song?
Absolutely... blah blah

PIANO STUDENTS
My piano students are imaginative, creative, musical. They’re individualistic thinkers. They define their own style and like to be current with Popular Music. They’re self motivated and they understand social nuances and cues in a more mature way.
