Thanks for reaching out!

I'm so jazzed that you took the time to connect. I appreciate that you live a busy North Bay life and have a **lot** of choices when it comes to music lessons in Marin County. I humbly hope that once you've read all the nitty gritty details you'll feel compelled to try me out with a [free lesson](#).

##What kind of a Music Teacher am I?

My #1 job is to empower **your** creative development and self expression in music. I bring a warm and lighthearted approach to teaching that is fun, engaging AND makes the learning part _easy_.

I'm not the kind of teacher who will drown you in endless scales or obsess over theory like a robot. While scales and theory do have a place they should never block your ability to connect to the _**magic**_ that is music.

In my lessons I will help you connect to your musical potential that lives within. I'll also give you the skills to access it for life. When you can free the songs in your heart you will navigate life from a place of inner power and bring joy to not only yourself but those around you. **Music is the universal language and I know you've got something to say**. If you don't believe in the power of music watch this:

## A Marin County Local

{Image of Studio} (Caption: The Chaiken Music Studio nestled amongst the greenery in Mill Valley)

I've been living and teaching music in Mill Valley (or Marin County) for over 15 years. I've been in love with it's natural beauty all this time and feel blessed to be a part of such a vibrant and progressive community. I never cease to be blown away by the innovative minds of all ages that live here.

I frequently take my teaching outside of the studio and have taught music and choral singing at numerous public and private  schools in Marin County including Edna Maguire, Middle School, Old Mill, Park School, Strawberry Point, Tam Valley, Brandeis Marin, Marin Primary & Middle School.

    {Testimonial}

    I realized just how special Caylia is after my daughter took an entire year of lessons and we were at her annual recital. It was full of supporting families and gosh, over 30 kids. They each went up and played a little song. It was a while before it suddenly dawned on me that **Caylia had single handedly taught every single one these kids everything that I was hearing that day!**  She truly is an amazing gift to our community and my children. - Wendy

I've also been fortunate to have directed many wonderful musical theatre programs in the North Bay Area.

## But what about those credentials...

Truth be told, I've got a lot of music teaching credentials under my belt. If you're a stickler for qualifications (like me) then here they are:

As a **musician and performer** I have a Bachelor of Arts from the [San Francisco Conservatory of Music](https://sfcm.edu/) and specialized in Voice and Piano. I also received a Bachelor of Fine Arts for Music and Musical Theater from [San Francisco State University](http://music.sfsu.edu/).

As an **educator** I hold a Masters of Education from Marin County's own [Dominican University of California](http://www.dominican.edu/) and am fully credentialed to teach music in the State of California.


##Am I a practicing musician?

The answer is unequivocally YES!

I would not be able to bring my passion for teaching without tapping into the source myself. I am a professional pianist, singer and songwriter and have performed across the USA. If you want to listen to some of my works then checkout [the store](#) and my [youtube channel](#). If you want to see me perform at an upcoming event be sure to [follow me on Facebook](#) for the latest event news.

##Still confused? On the fence?

Then why not have a dabble and try a [free lesson](#). What have you got to lose?

If you're feeling shy right now that's AOK. Why not [get in touch ](#)  and I'll be sure to answer any other questions you might have.
