I'm so jazzed that you've dropped by!

I know that you're super busy and have a **lot** of choices when it comes to music lessons in Marin County. I hope that once you've read all the nitty gritty below you'll feel compelled to try me out with a [free lesson](#).

##What kind of a Music Teacher am I?

My #1 job is to empower **your** creative development and self expression in music. I bring a warm and lighthearted approach to teaching that is fun and engaging AND makes the learning part _easy_.

We won't drown in endless scales or obsess over theory. They should never block your ability to connect to the **magic** of music.

My lessons will connect you to your innate musical talents and give you the skills to express them forever. You'll find the confidence to free the songs in your heart, bringing joy to yourself and those around you. **Music is the universal language and I know you've got something to say**.

## A Marin County Local

{Image of Studio} (Caption: The Chaiken Music Studio nestled amongst the greenery in Mill Valley)

I've been living and teaching music in Mill Valley for over 15 years. I'm in awe of its natural beauty and feel blessed to be part of such a vibrant and progressive community. So many creative and innovative people!

Many Marin County Schools have hosted my classes and workshops. We've had a blast learning music and choral singing at Edna Maguire, Middle School, Old Mill, Park School, Strawberry Point, Tam Valley, Brandeis Marin, Marin Primary & Middle School.

    {Testimonial}

    I realized just how special Caylia is after my daughter took an entire year of lessons and we were at her annual recital. It was full of supporting families and gosh, over 30 kids. They each went up and played a little song. It was a while before it suddenly dawned on me that **Caylia had single handedly taught every single one these kids everything that I was hearing that day!** She truly is an amazing gift to our community and my children. - Wendy

I've also been fortunate to have directed many wonderful musical theatre programs in the North Bay Area.

## Check out these credentials...

Truth be told, I've had a lot of excellent training. If you're a stickler for qualifications (like me) then here they are:

As a **musician and performer** I trained in voice and piano at the [San Francisco Conservatory of Music](https://sfcm.edu/) and was awarded Bachelor of Fine Arts for Music and Musical Theater from [San Francisco State University](http://music.sfsu.edu/).

As an **educator** I hold a Masters of Education from Marin County's own [Dominican University](http://www.dominican.edu/) and am fully credentialed to teach music in the State of California.

##Am I a practicing musician?

YES!

I wouldn't be able to bring so much passion to teaching without the nourishment of my own dedicated practice.

I am a professional pianist, singer and songwriter and have performed across the USA. You can listen to my work in [the store](#) and on my [YouTube channel](#). If you want to see me perform be sure to [follow me on Facebook](#) for the latest event news.

##Try a free lesson. What have you got to lose?

Why not have a dabble. Get your toes wet and let's make a splash!

If you're feeling shy right now that's AOK. Why not [get in touch ](#) and I'll be sure to answer any questions you might have.
