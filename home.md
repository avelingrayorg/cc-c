## Why Music?

Hans Christian Andersen could not have said it better when he penned these famous words:

> Where words fail...**music speaks**

Music is healing and transformative. It has the power to dissolve boundaries and bring people together from every corner of the world.

They call it the universal language for a good reason and despite what you might think **it lives within us all**!

## Why You?

---

> I’m thrilled you’re here—because we’re a lot alike, you and me. We’re both trying to make a life we love out of what we do.
> Which means neither of us can avoid one dreaded concept… self-promotion. As a small business owner, I bet you know firsthand how stressful marketing yourself and your business can be.

##Who are you and what do you do?

Thru teaching music and sharing my passion for music, I empower my students to expand and grow, learn how to navigate the world from a more centered and powerful space, and bring joy and happiness to their lives and the world by finding their music inside of themselves.

##Why did you create your company?

Because I deeply believe in the power of music.  I believe that music brings people together from every corner of the world, that music can heal you and is an acceptable way to express emotions.
