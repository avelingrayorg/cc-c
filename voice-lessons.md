Open up and say La!

Believe it or not, your voice is the most powerful emotional communication tool that you possess.

one of the most divepowerful communications medium




##Testimonial 1

I came to Caylia after years of vocal training. She is a dream. With her guidance I was able to retrain my voice so that I sang in an organic way, allowing my body to simply click into place. I am thrilled to be learning from her. - Emily , Kentfield

##The Nitty Gritty..

##Did you know...

That your voice box (a.k.a larynx) is not just used for making sweet sounds. It's main purpose is to protect your lungs from receiving food and water!

Every time you swallow the folds (or chords) of your voice box tightly close into a locked valve to protect the airway from everything but air.

When you sing you are slowly....blah


> The most important thing your larynx does is . . .
protect your lungs from food and water. The vocal folds form a valve that closes tightly to protect the airway. When you swallow, the glottis closes tightly --that is, the vocal folds adduct (come together) tightly. Also, the epiglottis folds over the glottis, and the larynx rises up while the esophagus opens to let the food/water enter. You've probably gotten water "down the wrong pipe" sometime in your life. That's because the water went down too fast for the glottis and epiglottis to protect the airway. When the water hit the vocal folds, they went into a cough reflex to expel the water and keep it out of the lungs. (Food or water in your lungs is a very bad thing.)

> The second most important thing your larynx does is . . .
trap air inside your lungs. This provides what we call "thoracic fixation," also known as the Valsalva maneuver. That is, trapping air inside the lungs provides air pressure, against which you push for excretion and childbirth, or stabilization for lifting.

> We share these laryngeal attributes with air-breathing animals. The fact that our larynx can also make beautiful sounds is one of our very special human attributes.

In your voice lesson you will be guided in learning the foundations of singing, breath control, ear training, rhythm recognition, diction, identify and expand vocal range, musical style and interpretation, performance technique, and nurturing of your own individual quality of sound and musical style.  You will experience an immediate change in how you sing and gain self-confidence as you learn to express yourself through your music!

At the beginning of your session your voice lesson will include “VOCALIZES”, vocal exercises, that help free your voice, expand your vocal range, implement breath and vocal control, maintain placement and support, and learn to open the mouth and throat to properly shape the sound of your unique voice.  After some fun, and sometimes goofy exercises, you will transfer the technique of open and relaxed singing in a song that is appropriate for your vocal range and musical taste.
As  you learn your song you start to transfer many of the vocal techniques and musicianship skills that you have learned in your exercises.  In the process of learning to sing, I will encourage you to find a personal interpretation of your song and make it your own!   

Singing is a natural extension of your speaking voice!  Learning to sing is very natural!  When you are born the first thing you do is cry. Crying is sustained sound and that is what you do when you sing!  Whether you sing for the love of it, want to become more confident in singing in public, or if you want to become a musical performer, singing is organic and a natural extension of your vocal expression.

In group sessions
students are encouraged to support and learn from their colleagues.  By observing someone else’s journey, you learn valuable skills of assessing another person’s vocal expertise, applying it to one’s own technique and “getting it” in a fun and supportive environment.  The group setting inspires quick learning and helpful guidance, along with invaluable qualities of empathy and encouragement.

Even if you don't want to sing professionally, learning how to free your voice can have all kinds of benefits. It can help you deal with stage fright, save you from losing your voice when you speak a lot, improve the tone in your speaking and singing voice, and help you to communicate with confidence.

As a performer, Musical Director, Vocal and Acting Coach and Arranger for many Children's and Adult Musical Theater productions, I can help you learn to be more comfortable being in front of a group, performing on stage, conducting meetings or just meeting new people.

Join the fun and sing with others, share your voices and learn to have fun playing as you learn life long skills in vocal production.
